In 2020, an estimated 281,550 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in women in the United States, along with 49,290 deaths from the disease.\n",

      "* Age: The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Most cases are diagnosed in women over the age of 50.\n",
      "* Family history: Women who have a family history of breast cancer are at an increased risk of developing the disease.\n",
      "* Personal history: Women who have had breast cancer in one breast are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast.\n",
      "* Reproductive history: Women who have never had children or who had their first child after the age of 30 are at an increased risk of breast cancer.\n",
      "* Dense breasts: Women with dense breasts have more fibrous and glandular tissue and less fatty tissue. This makes it more difficult to see cancer on a mammogram.\n",
      "* Certain inherited gene mutations: Certain inherited gene mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase the risk of breast cancer.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Get regular mammograms: Mammograms are the best way to detect breast cancer early, when it is most treatable. Women should start getting mammograms every year starting at age 40.\n",
      "* Perform monthly breast self-exams: Breast self-exams can help women find breast cancer early. Women should perform a breast self-exam every month starting at age 20.\n",
      "* Eat a healthy diet: A healthy diet can help reduce the risk of many types of cancer, including breast cancer. Women should eat a diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n",
      "* Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of breast cancer. Women should aim to maintain a healthy weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.\n",
      "* Exercise regularly: Exercise can help reduce the risk of many types of cancer, including breast cancer. Women should aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise each week.\n",
      "* Limit alcohol intake: Alcohol can increase the risk of breast cancer. Women should limit their alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day.\n",
